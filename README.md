<h1>About</h1>
<p>Terror in Milltown is point-and-click adventure game for Android that I developed over the course of 2014 as my first major project. The game was entirely designed and developed by me, save for a small number of sound effects and music assets.</p>
<p>Uploaded solely so it's archived somewhere: the code contained in this repository should not be read by anyone. Your skills will decline exponentially with every line read.</p>
<p>Code was extracted from the APK using a DEX decompiler and contains some comments and other modifications that weren't in the original implementation, but these changes don't present a material change from the original source code.</p>
